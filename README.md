My name is Cimmaron but you can call me Cimm. Sometimes known as the data wrangler :cowboy_hat_face: :racehorse:. 

My background is in the environmental sciences. I am particularly interested in toxic marine cyanobacteria, mycology, and environmental justice. I am currently looking for work as a data analyst or database administrator.

:arrow_right: I would like to upgrade my programming skills and pursue a postgraduate education in data science 
- I have enjoyed learning about more advanced computational statistics, especially Bayesian modelling 
  - Some fun things I have used in projects: **Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian estimation, time series models, Generalized Linear Models, experimental design, and statistical learning**
- I like **ArcGIS Pro** and **ESRI software** 🌐
- I primarily use **R** for my projects, working in **RStudio** with **R Markdown** 📊
  - I dabble in **Excel VBA** for some super helpful macros, and **SQL** for **ArcGIS Pro**
